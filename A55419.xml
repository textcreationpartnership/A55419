            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Subject of the inſuing diſcourſe is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though the Inſtrument is weak; for which cauſe ſome perhaps may ſay, Could not this man have found ſomething elſe to do, then to Write a Book, ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:3"/>
It is true, and bleſſed be God for plenty: Yet nevertheleſs, this may be of ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at leaſt to ſome, who have neither Money to buy, nor time to Read the Books, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection mentioned; and for ſuch this may be of uſe.</p>
            <p>And beſides, though the Nation doth abound with good Books, yet the houſes of (at leaſt) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, do not abound with them; nor their minds with the knowledge of them: Who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will have a mind to hear what this Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler will ſay; and it is poſſible ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may gain ſomething thereby: Which if it might be ſo, it would make amends for all my trouble in Writing.</p>
            <p>I know my end is to Alarum ſome poor ſouls, and to perſwade them to hearken to the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Goſpel; that ſo they may come and be welcome to the Marriage; for they and they onely are Bleſſed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 9.

            <p>I ſhall ſubject the following Diſcourſe to the peruſal and cenſure of the Reader, for whoſe

            <head>THE KINGDOME OF HEAVEN EXPLAINED</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Matth. 22. 2.</bibl>
               <q>The Kingdome of Heaven is like a certain King, that made a Marriage for his Son.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord Jeſus ſpake much to the <hi>Jews</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, and in a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Parable, he ſhews them what would be the event of their dealing with himſelf, and his Servants, which he ſent unto them: and they themſelves paſſes Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 41. <hi>He will miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe wicked men, and let out the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:5"/>
               <hi>to other Husband-men; that will render the Fruit in their Seaſon,</hi> Which hath been fully accompliſhed both to them and to us: they are deſtroyed, and we Gentiles ſaved; they are broken off, and we if we believe ſhall be Grafted in.</p>
            <p>They are deprived of the Goſpel, and we injoy it: which is the ſume of the Parable now under conſideration.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall take notes of three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What the Kingdome of Heaven is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How it may be compared to a Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherein the Parable doth not hold; for in all things Parables do not hold.</p>
            <p>And then I ſhall deſire to conſider wherein the whole may be profitable to us.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt; a Kingdom doth impoſe a King and Subjects, and ſo do the Kingdome of Heaven, ſuppoſeth a Heavenly King, and Heavenly Subjects; and then Chriſt and his
<pb facs="tcp:98434:5"/>
Church are to be taken for the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But then the Queſtion is, what is the Church? The anſwer is, it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Firſt, In its Militant, or elſe, Secondly, In its Triumphant ſtate; and in both theſe it will fall under a two fold conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Militant or warring ſtate; we muſt conſider it as it's Catholick, conſiſting of the univerſal Body: Among whom there is no Prophane, nor Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſon.</p>
            <p>And in this ſenſe they are called, <hi>The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt born, that are written in Heaven.</hi> Heb. 12. 23. <hi>My Dove, my undefiled;</hi> is but one Song of Songs, 6. 8. <hi>They are that whole Family in Heaven and Earth. Eph.</hi> 3. 15. So all the Saints make up but one Church in this ſence.</p>
            <p>But in a ſecond ſenſe, the Church is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into particular Churches, as 7 in <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 1. 4. In <hi>Galacia</hi> divers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22. As alſo at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and more that might be mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:6"/>
Now in the Church in this ſence there were in the primitive days, and have been ſince, and will be ſo to the laſt; ſome Hypocrites <hi>John</hi> 2. 19 <hi>Jude</hi> 4. <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs ſurpriſeth the Hypocrits.</hi> Which ſeems to be at the laſt day: There were fooliſh Virgins among the Wiſe, when the Mid-night cry is made, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. For the Net of the Goſpel doth bring to ſhore bad Fiſh as well as good. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 47, 48. But it greatly concerns the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to take care that ſuch be not there by their allowance, if they are made manifeſt to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>But the Church Triumphant, is alſo the Kingdome of Heaven, and falls under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration alſo; and <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may conſider it as with reſpect to the firſt ſtate of Glory, in which ſtate Chriſt and his Saints ſhall Reign Gloriouſly together, according to, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>I beheld, till the Thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe Garment was as White as Snow, and the Hair of his Head as the pure Wool; his Throne was like the burning flame, and his Wheels as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire: A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him; thouſand thouſands Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered unto him; and ten thouſand times ten</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:6"/>
               <hi>thouſand ſtood before him; the Judgment was ſet and the Books were opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This muſt needs be a day of great Glory, when this glorious King ſhall come, with his Glorious attendants, to ſit upon his Glorious Throne, when all other Thrones muſt be caſt down. But what is this to the Saints? I anſwer, When Chriſt ſhall poſſeſs the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, his Saints ſhall poſſeſs it with him, as appears by comparing <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. with the 22, and 27 <hi>verſes</hi> together: in <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>There was given him (viz.</hi> the Son of Man that came with the Clouds of Heaven) <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Nations, and Languages, ſhould ſerve and obey him.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. 22. It is ſaid, <hi>The Horns made War with the Saints, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt them, until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the Saints of the moſt high; and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdome.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>And the Kingdome, and Domion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdome under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When ſhall this be accompliſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:7"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think I may ſafely ſay, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this we know, that it is to be after the Seventh Angel ſounds his Trumpet; and the Myſtery of the Kingdome of God is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. and, 11, 15. compared; but let it ſuffice, that we know it ſhall be a ſtate of very great Glory.</p>
            <p>And whether it ſhall be a thouſand years Glory, before Chriſts viſible comming; as ſome ſay, or that it ſhall begin when he ſhall come from Heaven to judge the World, as others ſay; is a Miſtery too great for me to hold forth, but it will be the firſt ſtate of the Church Triumphant; a ſtate of Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glory: And bleſſed are they that are called to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 9.</p>
            <p>Again, The final ſtate of the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant is, <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the Kingdome to God his Father, that God may be all in all.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. Which will be when the Lord Chriſt hath finiſhed the Judgment, and the final Sentence is paſt, of <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, and receive the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:7"/>
               <hi>And go ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now both theſe ſtates, are ſo Glorious, as can no way be conceived of by Mortal man. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>And thus briefly I have paſſed through the firſt thing propounded; <hi>viz.</hi> what the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, Wherein it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a Princely Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Marriage of Great Perſons, the Father doth determine to provide a Match for his Son: Even ſo God the Father did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, to take a Wife for his Son Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World.</hi> Rom. 8. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the Father intends; ſo the Son accepts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Chriſt the Son gave himſelf for his Church, to waſh it, to cleanſe it, and to preſent it to himſelf a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a time appointed for
<pb facs="tcp:98434:8"/>
the Marriage Solemnity. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Marriage of the Lamb is come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Some are ſent out to invite: and hear we may take notice; who were the firſt intended Gueſts, and that was the <hi>Jews:</hi> To whom Chriſt ſent, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtles; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſent the Seventy. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1. They were they that firſt were called to come; of whom, ſome ſlited the invitation; preferring their Worldly occaſions, before Goſpel priviledges. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. And others of them abuſed; yea, ſlew the Meſſengers that were ſent; yea, even the Son himſelf. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>And when the Jews Blaſphem'a; and ſpoke againſt the things which</hi> Paul <hi>Preached,</hi> Acts 13. 45, 46. <hi>Then</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>waxed bold, and ſaid, it is meet the word of God ſhould firſt be ſpoken to you; but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of eternal life: Loe, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe were the Church to whom the lively Oracles were given. Theſe were the Mura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers whom GOD deſtroyed, whoſe City was burnt,</hi> Mat. 22. 7. Which was fulfill'd by
<pb facs="tcp:98434:8"/>
               <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; about 40 years after Chriſt: When they and their City were in a moſt dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtroy'd, by Fire, Famine, Sword, and Peſtilence, fulfilling the Words of Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 21.</p>
            <p>But to whom did the King ſend when the <hi>Jews</hi> were rejected?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Who were as the Blind, the Halt, and the Maimed, like poor Vagrant Beggers, in the High-ways, and under the Hedges. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Being without Chriſt, Aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Promiſe, without Hope, and without God in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Sinners of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called, of whom was Conſtituted the firſt Gentile Church, to wit, at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 11. 26. the Churches in <hi>Galatia. Gal.</hi> 1. 2. From theſe came the 7 Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> with many more.</p>
            <p>Againſt a great Wedding there is great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration beforehand, againſt the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of ſuitable Apparel, ſo in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the Bride muſt have her Glorious Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; <hi>The Kings Daughter is all Glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> Pſal. 45. 13, 14. Rev. 19. 8, 9. <hi>To her</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:9"/>
               <hi>was granted ſhe ſhould be arrayed with fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, clean and White; and the fine Linnen is the Righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There muſt be preparation by the Gueſts; they muſt have Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 11 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There muſt be preparation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, for entertainment; ſo it muſt be in the Spiritual Marriage; as it reſembles the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1 2, 3 4, 5 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> 25 6 And it is the cuſtom to have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Gueſts to refreſh themſelves with, before the Dinner be ready; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bridegroom comes to ſit down at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: So is it here, the bleſſed Bridegroom doth prepare good things for his Gueſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Dinner be ſerved in; he hath appointed for them his Laws, and bleſſed. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; to comfort and cheer them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; <hi>Wherein they have Communion not onely one with another; but with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 10 16, 17. <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we Bleſs, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt? the Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? for we being many, are one Body: for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Little do the poor World think what the
<pb facs="tcp:98434:9"/>
people of the Lord do enjoy in Corners; They can ſay at ſometimes, <hi>They have meat to eat that the World knows not of:</hi> They can get into a Corner, and poure out their ſouls to God, when their Enemies perſecute them. 142. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7. Compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 17. <hi>He will regard the Prayer of the Deſtitute, and will not deſpiſe their Prayer.</hi> The Lord makes the hearts of his Gueſts to rejoyce, before they come <hi>to ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdome of their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There muſt be a ſet time for to Solemnize the Marriage; ſo it is in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; as it reſembles the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> Pſal. 45. 9. <hi>Kings Daughters were among thy Honourable Women, upon thy right hand, did ſtand the Queen in Gold of</hi> Ophir, ver. 14. <hi>She ſhall be brought unto the King in Raiment of Needle Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be very Glorious Raiment, <hi>That ſhall cauſe her to ſhine as the Sun in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Mat. 13. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> There is great joy in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Chamber; ſo will it be in this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Marriage; as it reſembles the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Let us rejoyce and be glad, and give Honour to him; for the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:10"/>
               <hi>Marriage of the Lamb is come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Tongue can expreſs the Glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of that day, the Heavenly Muſick will then ſtrike up, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 3. 4. Now ſhall the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſolace themſelves in each others love; unſpeakably, beyond the Joy of any other Bride-Groom, and Bride in all the World.</p>
            <p>The third thing propounded, is to note ſome things wherein this, and other Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages do not reſemble each other.</p>
            <p>As firſt, All the appointing, inviting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, rejoycing, compleating, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; is all upon a natural account: and the other all upon a Spiritual account; as hath been already ſhown.</p>
            <p>And as it is natural and not ſpiritual, ſo alſo it is temporal and not perpetual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> All other Wedding days have an end, but this ſhall never end; <hi>For thoſe that dye before Chriſts comming, ſhall be both caught up to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall be ever with the Lord: Theſe are words to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another withal.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> In other Weddings they put off their VVedding Apparel again; but it is not ſo here. <hi>Daniel</hi> 13. 3. <hi>They that be Wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and thoſe turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:10"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all other wedding feaſts, thoſe that partake thereof will hunger again, and thirſt again; but not ſo in this Spiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. read from <hi>ver.</hi> 8. to <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In other Marriages the joy and the ſound of the Muſick ceaſes; but in this Spiritual Marriage, they ſhall ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb eternally. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In other Marriages the beauty and comlineſs of the Bride decays in a little time; but not ſo here, in the Kingdom there ſhall be no withered faces; nor eyes ſunk in their holes; no aking Backs, nor feeble Limbs. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 8</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> All other Bridegrooms and their Brides, muſt part again in a little time? Oh how ſoon is their days of Feaſting and joy, turned into ſorrow and mourning! and thoſe that did follow them to the VVedding, in a little time follow them to the Grave? This daily experience proves. But this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bridegroom, never ſhall; never will, part with his lovely Bride. No, Death is now Conquer'd; and were it not; it could not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate between the Bride-groom Chriſt, and his Bride the Church; no, nor with any one
<pb facs="tcp:98434:11"/>
Member of it. <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 35. 36, 37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In other Marriages, the Gueſts and the Bride, are diſtinct; but not ſo in this, for every one that cometh to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage upon the call or invitation, ſhall be a Member of the Bride, and ſhall enjoy full Communion with the Bridegroom. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father; and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe things Write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</hi> Pſal. 16. 11. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth thing, and the laſt, is to conſider how we may improve this Parable, to our own Advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> And firſt, It ſhows us how we ought to admire the goodneſs of God, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to invite us poor blind, lame, high-way Vagrants to come to the Glorious Marriage, <hi>That we who were Children of Wrath by nature,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. And had been long <hi>treaſuring up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous Judgment of God, ſhould be invited in.</hi> Rom. 2. 5. Oh, infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! that we, <hi>Who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, ſhould be quickned; and that together with Chriſt, and ſaved by Grace.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:11"/>
Oh that the Lord ſhould paſs by the wide VVorld! and ſend his Goſpel into this poor Iſland; and plant it here, and continue i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> them that have been ſent unto them? to ſay no worſe of it: but let thoſe that fear the Lord, and have been moderate to come in at the Call, ſay let the Lord be praiſed: ſeeing he hath left a great part of the world to worſhip the Devil; a great part to worſhip <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and a great part of the world to worſhip the <hi>Beaſt. Rev.</hi> 13 8. All theſe are without the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, without any means to come to the right knowledge of God, and Chriſt; Nay, they have that which is a great deal worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, being deceived by thoſe Impoſtures,
<pb facs="tcp:98434:12"/>
whoſe work it is to bewitch poor ſouls, and to prevent them of good, any good; <hi>and make them ſeven fold more the Children of Wrath, by their means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But bleſſed be your Eyes, that you ſee, and your Ears that you hear. Oh let it be the care of every one that hath taſted that the Lord is gracious to be by all means endeavouring to ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called you out of darkneſs, into his marvellous light. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A ſecond uſe to be made of this Parable, is to examine whether we have hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to the invitation or no; and to help herein, the Scripture doth afford us many rules to try by; I ſhall name ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Note,</hi> As firſt, If we have indeed hearkned to the Lords Call, then your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is enlightned, which before was dark; Compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. with the 4. 18. <hi>By this we come to know what is the riches of the Glory of his inheritance, in the Saints; and what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward that beleive;</hi> which we underſtood not before; by this new Light, we come to ſee how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our eſtate was by nature; and what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being brought out of that ſtate, or elſe that eternal. VVrath muſt have been our Portion: By this we come to ſee an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:98434:12"/>
in the Goſpel, and the knowledge of God thereby: Now we ſee a Glorious beauty in Holineſs; and in the the ways of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we counted them Fools that made much ado about Religion, <hi>To know how they might walk and pleaſe God:</hi> But now I ſee they were wiſer then we: Now we can prize a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt, and an intereſt in him above the world, and all that is in it: as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Note,</hi> A ſecond Note, If we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Call of God in the Goſpel, our affections are ſet upon other Objects then they were before; for before the world; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the pleaſures of it, or the riches of it, or the honour of it, carried away our joy, our delight, our deſire, our love, but now we can rejoyce in Gods word above all. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119 162. <hi>I rejoyce in thy word as he that findeth great ſpoyl. This is more to be deſired by a Gracious ſoul, then much fine Gold; and is ſweeter then Honey, and the Honey Comb.</hi> Pſal. 19. 10.</p>
            <p>Now the deſire is after the knowledge of God and Chriſt, which before was after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; which carries the ſoul out to the uſe of ſuch means as tends to the attaining thereof; as praying, reading, hearing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing; and though others may do the ſame thing, yet not to the ſame end, they do it to
<pb facs="tcp:98434:13"/>
grow thereby. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. To wit, That they may grow in grace, and the knowlede of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Their love is now ſet on God, and the ways of God, and the People of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were diſpiſed. But I do but hint thoſe things, which will be found in thoſe that have imbraced the Call.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Note,</hi> Again, When Souls have imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Call, they can never more after that; ſin with full conſent of the will: If any Evil be committed, it is by means of the Law of the Members, that doth rebel againſt the Law of the Mind; which cauſes a continual VVar between the fleſh, and the Spirit; which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Soul to God to cry out for help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Rebel, this Law in the Members; as <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12, 13. It will be the great care of ſuch Souls to keep their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment undefiled. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>v.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>He that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> Joh. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>Let us carefully, and faithfully, prove our ſelves by theſe things, and by what elſe the Lord may help us in, that we may not miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this matter, that is of ſuch wonderful concernment, as relates to our eternal weal, or woe; our eternal life, or eternal death; for a little time will bring to the gates of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <hi>and time will be no more:</hi> Then it will
<pb facs="tcp:98434:13"/>
be too late for fooliſh Virgins, to cry, <hi>Lord, open to us:</hi> Now is the time for us to hear, that our Souls may live. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we have all this while neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear, and have had our excuſes as the bidden Gueſt had: Let me admire the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God that has ſpared us ſo long, while we have provok'd him by delaying to hear: O doubtleſs, he might have ſaid long ago, <hi>They ſhall not taſt of my Supper:</hi> But ſeeing it is no worſe, but that the Lord is ſtill ſending after us; let us take heed of delays, leſt we come to the Gate of Mercy when it is ſhut, and muſt never more be opened.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> A Third uſe therefore, that we may, and ought to make uſe of this Parable, is to perſwade, and exhort, poor Souls to come at in the Call.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Motive,</hi> And for Motives, conſider that Eternity of weal or woe, depends upon the well or ill ſpending of a little time. <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>If the Tree falleth towards the</hi> South, <hi>or towards the</hi> North, <hi>in the place where it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, there it ſhall be:</hi> A little moment let ſlipt may loſe Heaven and happineſs, and plunge us under the unſupportable Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an infinite God: Oh, <hi>While it is called to day, harden not your hearts ſo long, till God ſware in his Wrath, you ſhall not enter into</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:14"/>
               <hi>his Rest.</hi> Heb. 3. 11, 15. After the Lord had Sworn in his wrath they ſhould not enter; it was then too late to attempt it, as appears, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 42. 43, 44, 45 Let us not ſay, we have bought a Farm, bought Oxen, or Married a Wife; but come at the firſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, leſt the door be ſhut, and you ſtand and knock to no purpoſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. It will be a dreadful thing, for the great God to laugh at poor Souls in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: ſurely that will increaſe their miſery.</p>
            <p>If one were in great diſtreſs, and ſhould ſee one that had power to help, that would only look upon him, but not pity him, nor yield any relief to him; it would be very grievous to him. But if he ſhould ſtand and mock at him; it would be much more grievous. To hear ſuch a one ſay, Nay, you are ſerved well enough. I called upon you to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but you ſlited my Advice, though I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to ſave you out of it; yea, I pray'd you, and intreated you, to let me help you out of this horrible Pit, but ye refuſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 2. No intreaty would ſerve, therefore if you can now ſave your ſelf do; I'le have nothing to do with you. This will greatly increaſe their woe; even ſo, and much more will be the aggravations of their torment, who ſhall have the Lord ſpeak ſo to them as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20,
<pb facs="tcp:98434:14"/>
22, 23, 24. O that poor Souls would not let ſlip the day of Grace; <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he alſo is fleſh. Gen.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p>Shall God in pity ſay, as he did to <hi>Iſpael</hi> of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29. <hi>O that they were Wiſe, that they would conſider this, that they would remember their latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall we not regard it: it will be ſad with thoſe Souls that ſhall make light of the Call, till God will ſend no more after them; but ſhall ſend to thoſe that will come; and for ever exclude thoſe bidden ones: and they forced to cry out, as they in <hi>Jeremy, Jer.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>The Harvest is paſt, and the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Motive,</hi> To come at the Call of God, is becauſe we are every day further off from God then other; we are like a Ship under Sayl, driven by fierce Winds; it cannot ſtand ſtill, but is in perpetual motion, toward ſome Port or other; and is every hour nearer to the place whither they are bound, ſo long as the Wind is for them. Thoſe that are bound for Hell (as all Men and VVomen in the VVorld are before Converſion) they get nearer and nearer Hell every day; and they run a very ſwift Courage, the Devil trims the Sails, and raiſeth the wind of temptation,
<pb facs="tcp:98434:15"/>
and makes good the Proverb, <hi>They muſt needs go, that the Devil drives:</hi> But he perſwades them they were bound for Heaven, that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Country that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſought after; for the Devil in this, is like thoſe Men that are called Spirits, that flatters Children with fair words, and fine toyes, to go with them, till they have got them out of the reach of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and then, and not till then; they will let them ſee they are certainly Slaves paſt all Recovery.</p>
            <p>Oh be not ſuch Children, as to be flatter'd with worldly toyes, out of the hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joyes; and ſo ſuffer your ſelves to be carried into endleſs woes: For remember, till you tack about, you are nearer Hell every day; and ſo conſequently, further off from God, and Chriſt, and Glory: O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emember whither you are going, and turn again before it be too late: Let not Chriſt ſay of you as of the <hi>Jews, Ye will not come to me, that you might have life, John</hi> 5. 40. O that poor men and women, would take Counſel of Wiſdom, crying after them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22 23, 24. <hi>Turn as my Reproof. I will pour out my Spirit unto you; I will make known my words unto you.</hi> O harken, before it be too late, hear that your Souls may live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. Let not Satan get you one ſtep nearer Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you turn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:15"/>
3. <hi>Motive,</hi> Thoſe Souls that delay to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and come in upon the invitation, will make their work more hard and difficult, if ever they do reform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the longer they go on in ſin, the more hardned they will be in ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, viz.</hi> (While the day of Grace and opportunity laſt) <hi>leſt any of you be hardned by the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Sin is deceitful, and the Devil is deceitful, and mans heart is deceitful; and theſe three agree in one. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. Even to deceive poor Souls with the Golden Baits of worldly injoyments, till Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be hid from their Eyes: <hi>And ſo their Oyl be to ſeek when the Bride-groom comes, and the door be ſhut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will be difficult to return after long delays becauſe Cuſtome is as it were a ſecond nature. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 25. <hi>Can the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian change his Skin? or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye alſo do good, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do evil.</hi> We know Old Ulcers, are hardly, hardly, Clenſed, and Cured; when an eaſe and ſpeedy Cure may be made of a Green Wound. Poyſon when it is firſt taken, may be expel'd; but by continuance in the body, till it have inſected the Vitals, the Cure will be very difficult and hazardous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:16"/>
3<hi>ly.</hi> The longer we go on in ſin, the more difficult will be our return, becauſe one ſin draws on another; and ſo we ſhall have more ſins to repent of, and the more work we have to do, the more diſcouragement will be as to the undertaking of it: Repentance is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and ſeeing it is ſo, it will be eaſier to repent of ſin betime: It is a kind of madneſs for a man to go on in a Trade, that he knows he muſt repent that ever he medled with it; and muſt throw it off, or elſe it will utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do him; every one will ſay, The ſooner the better. Better to be rid of ſuch an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a man loſes by every day; we loſe by ſin every day, and treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath. If a fire kindle upon our Houſe, the way to quench it, is not to add more fuel to it. Now Sin ſets Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on fire; <hi>And the breath of the Lord, as a ſtream of Brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> Iſa. 30. 33. The Devil knows what he does, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Souls to delay their coming in at the firſt Call; he knows that the work of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be more difficult: If a Nail be but entred, it may be eaſier pull'd out, then if by continual knocking it is driven up to the head: To add ſin to ſin, is as to add to a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to make it to be carried the more eaſily. This is like what is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. <hi>When</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:16"/>
               <hi>the Curſe of God is pronounced againſt ſin, and one ſay, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imaginations of my own heart; to add Drunker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Thirſt.</hi> See what the Lord ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but his anger and his Jealouſie, ſhall ſmoak againſt him; and all the Curſes that are Written in this Book, ſhall lye upon him.</hi> O then take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays; for the work will be more difficult to morrow, then it is to day: O then while it is called to day, harden not thy heart.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Motive,</hi> Come in quickly, for elſe thou may'ſt not have ſo much time to ſerve the Lord, as thou haſt ſpent in ſerving the Devil, who is thy deadly Enemy, who intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thy eternal Ruine.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Motive,</hi> Conſider thou haſt run a great hazard all this while; the Lord might have cut aſunder the thred of thy life before now, and thou mighteſt have dropt into Hell, from whence there is no Redemption; and wilt thou venture ſtill; if once he ſtrike, he will ſtrike home.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Motive,</hi> Conſider what thou loſeſt by delays.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou loſeſt the preſence of God; the Communion of Saints, the comfort of the Holy Spirit, which although the wicked men count the Godly fools, and think they live
<pb facs="tcp:98434:17"/>
a mopiſh, uncomfortable life, yet <hi>is their joy as the joy of Harveſt; and as thoſe that find a great ſpoil.</hi> Iſa. 9. 3. ſee 1 Joh. 1. 4. Pſal. 16. 11. <hi>ſee,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. So that by delaying to come at the firſt, although at laſt thou do come, yet thou art a great loſer, in regard of that early joy, which thou mighteſt have had by comming in ſooner. For the Lord doth not call upon thee to come and make thy condition worſe than before. It is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to think that the Devils ſervice is more comfortable then Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou loſeſt the advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming famous in grace and holineſs; if a man be in a thriving way, yet if he fall into it but a little before he dye, he is not like to be very Rich. Oh, therefore hearken to the Call betime, that ſo thou may'ſt be rich in Grace, rich in good Works, and then thou ſhalt have a rich Reward in the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By delayes thou may'ſt loſe all, and come as the Fooliſh Virgins did. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. When the Door was ſhut; and as thoſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>That Propheſied in the Name of Chriſt, and caſt out Devils in his Name; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet cannot be admitted: When once the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door,</hi> Luk. 13. 25. <hi>It will be then no boot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:17"/>
               <hi>knock;</hi> and this is a loſs indeed: to loſe the favour of God, the love of Chriſt, the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Holy Spirit, the Communion of all the bleſſed Angels, and Saints; thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Heaven, and happineſs, and all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Felicity, which was tendered to thee in the invitation.</p>
            <p>But that is not all; but thoſe that loſe God, gain the Devil; thoſe that loſe Heaven, gain Hell; which gain is a dreadful loſs: as will more fully appear, by ſetting forth ſome of the properties of Heaven, and Hell, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the one againſt the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firſt, In Heaven there is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Spirit; in Hell is the Devil and all his Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Heaven there is an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Glorified Saints, and Angels; in Hell there is an innumerable Company of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, damn'd Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Heaven there is nothing but Joy and Singing; in Hell is nothing but weeping, and wailing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Heaven there is Glorious Light, that no Mortal Eye can approach unto; in Hell there is outer Darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 13. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs, of Darkneſs for ever. <hi>Jude.</hi> 3. Oh what a diſparity is here? between theſe two! the Darkneſs of <hi>Egypt</hi> was but
<pb facs="tcp:98434:18"/>
a Figure of this Black Darkneſs: And as it is very comfortable to behold the Light, ſo it is very dreadful to be deprived of all Light; to be alone in the Dark is frightful; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be outer Darkneſs; but ten thouſand times better to be quite alone, then to be in the midſt of innumerable Devils, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful damn'd Spirits.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Heaven is whatever may delight both Soul, and Body; but in Hell there is whatever may add to miſery and torment, of ſoul and body.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firſt, There is fire into which they ſhall be caſt, that have their portion there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as it is Fire (which in it ſelf is dreadful) even ſo it is the worſt fire; <hi>viz.</hi> Brimſtone, and Fire; even as God when he would pour out his wrath upon <hi>Sodom (who ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire)</hi> Jude, 7. <hi>It was with Brimſtone, and fire from the Lord out of Heaven.</hi> Gen. 19. 24. And it is hard to indure the ſtink of Brimſtone and fire, though we feel not the burning of it. But ſome may ſay it is not material Fire; to which one make anſwer, and ſays, Then it is worſe; becauſe that the Figure is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the ſubſtance: So that at the beſt, it is Fire and Brimſtone; Oh, how dreadful will it be to endure it? When I have had
<pb facs="tcp:98434:18"/>
the Smoak of Brimſtone aſcend into my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, it hath been terrible, though but for a moment: And when I have ſtood by a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Oven; I have thought, Oh how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would it be to be alive in that flame? though but for a very little ſpace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This fire is dark fire, the comfortable property of Light is taken from it, for in Hell there muſt be nothing that can yield any comfort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, It is ſuch fire that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the matter that is laid into it; but the fire and the Fuel (to wit, Devils and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men) muſt remain and abide in that fire together.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And therefore <hi>this Fire is Eternal.</hi> Jude, 7. <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. And this makes it dreadful indeed: All the miſeries of this life will quickly end, they are but light and momentary. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 17. But theſe ſhall never end; and this doth compleat the miſery of the Damn'd: There will be no end of their miſery; no eaſe in their miſery, no mitigation of their miſery; no deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their, nor relief in their miſery. No end as is ſaid before; and as one ſaith, If the Damn'd did know, that he ſhould ſuffer no more thouſands of years, then there be Sands in the Sea: or no more Millions of
<pb facs="tcp:98434:19"/>
Ages, then there be Sands in the Sea; it would much comfort him; but alas, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtill. Another Writes thus, ſuppoſe the whole Globe of the Earth were a Mountain of Sand; and fill'd up with Sand to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Heavens, and a Wren ſhould come once in an hundred years, and fetch away the tenth part of a Grain of this Sand; if when all this Sand was fetcht away, the Damn'd might come out of Hell, it would be ſome comfort to them: But ſtill it is as before, it is for ever ſtill; Oh, what an amazing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is this; and yet how few lay it to heart.</p>
            <p>Now conſidering theſe things, is it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſs to reject, or but neglect to come to the Marriage upon the firſt Call, of the Lords Servants that are ſent to invite thee. <hi>How ſhall they eſcape, that neglect ſo great Salvation;</hi> All muſt come to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or go to the Dungeon, <hi>Where the Worm never dyes, nor the Fire goes not out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider there is no eaſe, as there is no end; if one did know certainly, that he muſt indure the pain but of an aking Tooth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eaſe, for the ſpace of one whole Year: Oh! how grievous would the very thoughts of it be! How long doth one night
<pb facs="tcp:98434:19"/>
ſeem to one in miſery? What ſhall we ſay to Eternity, when not any one Member ſhall be in pain; but the whole Man, Soul, and Body, ſhall be in pain; in torment, not only for a Night, or a Year, but for ever; in which there is no intermiſſion, no hope, no relief, no not a drop of water for ever, to cool a flaming Tongue: all hope of help be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off for ever: Lay all theſe Motives together (to which many might be added) for a ſpeedy comming in; and then tell me, whether even reaſon it ſelf, will not conclude it is beſt to hear, that your Souls may live. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3.</p>
            <p>Will a Months living in pleaſure, in pride, in the eager perſute of Riches; make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the loſs of the Glory mentioned before; and for undergoing of wrath and vengeance in Hell fire. <hi>Man being in honour, abideth not.</hi> Pſal. 49. 12.

                  </gap>r.</hi> 13. This then is their folly: Indeed it is egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous folly to loſe Heaven, for a little Earth; Heavenly treaſure, for Earthly pleaſure, for a Barley Corn, to loſe the Pearl of great price. Alas, <hi>All fleſh is Graſs, and all the Glory of Man, as the flowers of the Graſs,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98434:20"/>
               <hi>the Graſs withereth, and the Flower fadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: How oft do we ſee the Flower wither before the Sithe come to cut down the Graſs: How oft do we ſee the Glory of Man iſſue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leave the World? And yet what a little, little time, do they abide in the World.</hi> The Sithe comes and Mows down this Graſs ſpeedily.

            <p>Again conſider, that although thou have forgot moſt of thy ſins, which are without number: God hath not forgot any of them, but they are all charged in Gods Book, till Repentance wipe out the Score.</p>
            <p>Again conſider, That ſo long as thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt in thy ſinful ſtate, thou art pleaſing and ſerving the Devil, inſtead of God, and he is thy God, though thou think not ſo it may be.</p>
            <p>Again conſider, How little time thou haſt for ſo great a work, as to make thy Calling and Election ſure; and it may be a great deal leſs then thou art aware of.</p>
            <p>Then again conſider, The infinite Grace and patience of God, thou mighteſt have been in Hell; ſtand and wonder thou art not: O let mercy melt thee; let Grace move thee; let this love of Chriſt conſtrain thee: he that dyed for ſinners to ſave them from their ſins, and from the Wrath of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10.

We ſee among People, a great care to have the body adorned; but, O the little care of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves unſpotted of the World; that is to be found among many: When they are to go into the preſence of the King; to ſtand before him, and to hear his voyce in the Miniſtry of his VVord. I am afraid, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſing Godlineſs, take more care, and
<pb facs="tcp:98434:22"/>
ſpend more time to have their Garments faſhionable and compleat; and their Attire neatly ſet, then they do to have their Souls trimmed for to come before the Bridegroom; the time ſpent in Prayer is but little, which many before they go before the Lord, that they might <hi>be helped to ſerve God acceptably, with Reverence and Godly fear;</hi> as Heb. 12. 28. I deſire that our fine faſhionable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would Read conſcionably, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. 4. 5. That they might lay aſide their bables, and <hi>learn of the Holy Women that truſted in God, to adorn themſelves.</hi> I fear indeed that while ſo much care is taken for the Body, to adorn it; it is no other then the Fruit of a proud heart; which renders a perſon more odious in the Eyes of the King of Heaven, then the naſtieſt Begger, with his Louſie Rags, would be in the preſence of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King.</p>
            <p>Pride is not the only defiling ſin, there are more attending it; for there muſt be Covetouſneſs to maintain pride: and as pride promotes Covetouſneſs, ſo alſo Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, is Prides Hand-maid: But in a word, every ſin is a ſtain in the VVhite Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; O therefore, watch againſt evil words with <hi>David,</hi> 93. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.

            <p>Again, As thou art careful to have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Marriage-Chamber, to have a VVedding Garment, and to have it clean; ſo be careful of thy Family; wouldſt thou not be glad to have thy Friends and Relations admitted? take heed thou do not promote ſin, nor countenance ſin in any: It is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to ſee how many Parents promote Pride in their Children, dreſſing them up with toys; which is as it was a watering of that Curſed Root: You may obſerve how the Child will mince and jet, when it is made more fine then ordinary: And ſo by this means, <hi>inſtead of bringing them up in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Admonition of the Lord;</hi> They fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in the ſervice of the Devil.

in the Marriage Chamber; pray often and earneſtly, not only publickly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately: Hear the word of God conſtantly, conſcionably, and diligently; labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it carefully, prove what thou heareſt knowingly; and what thou findeſt to be the mind of God, practice it faithfully, bring duty into practice effectually, and zealouſly, and God ſhall make thee happy eternally.</p>
